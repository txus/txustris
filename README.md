# txustris

This is the very first Ruby code I wrote, back in 2008-2009. It is a clone of
Tetris with an original soundtrack :) The code might sucks, but the game is
fun!

As of September 2013, I corrected its syntax so that it runs on Ruby 1.9/2.0
and people can play it. And it works with the latest Gosu, no changes at all!

    git clone git://github.com/txus/txustris
    gem install gosu
    ruby init.rb

Have fun! <3
